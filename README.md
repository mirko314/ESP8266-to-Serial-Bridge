# ESP8266-to-Serial-Bridge
PCB Design for faster Programming of the ESP8266 using a Serial-Usb Adaptor
The ESP8266 Chip can be programmed through Serial.

Taking Inspiration from http://arduino-hannover.de/2015/04/08/arduino-ide-mit-dem-esp8266/ this PCB uses a slightly different USB-to-Serial Brisge. The PCB does Break Out the Pins and enables the user to program the Module easily.
